# Breast Cancer Classification Repository

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models for classifying mammograms to aid in breast cancer detection.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **ann-wbcd/**
   - Implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying mammograms using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD).

2. **mini-MIAS/**
   - Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying mammograms using the mini-MIAS dataset.

3. **cbis-ddsm/**
   - Implementation of transfer learning and CNN for classifying mammograms using the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) dataset.

## Repository Overview

This repository showcases different approaches to breast cancer classification using machine learning techniques. Each folder contains detailed implementations and results for the respective dataset and model.

- `ann-wbcd/`: Utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) to classify mammograms.

- `mini-MIAS/`: Employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the mini-MIAS dataset for mammogram classification.

- `cbis-ddsm/`: Demonstrates the use of transfer learning and CNN on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) for accurate classification.

## Instructions

Feel free to explore each folder to understand the implementations and methodologies used for breast cancer classification. Detailed documentation and results are provided within each directory.
